# My Degree - Full-Stack Data Science

## Introduction

As a data scientist with *"only"* with a bachelor's in Physics and Mathematics,
I have the feeling that the frontiers of my current knowledge have been reached.
To prevent stagnation in my long-term growth, I have designed this curriculum. 
This aims to address several areas, the first one being a foundational recap
of the background theory of statistics/probably, machine learning and neural networks.
Whilst I have had a moderate chunk of experience in these areas within my degree and job,
there are holes and rusty parts of my knowledge.
Furthermore, before starting more advanced courses I think would make sense to recap the theory
that most of these courses build upon.
