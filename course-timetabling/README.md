# Course Timetable

The goal with each week is to commit on average 6hrs of learning. The 6hrs measure will be a rough measuring stick used to gauge the course structure week on week. I will update the documents within this directory as I progress through a given course, accounting for any troughs or peaks in progression pace. As well as this, I may add or subtract courses.
